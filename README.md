cd ehailing-cms
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash

# or

3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

## Environment Variables

For the application to function correctly, including database connectivity and email services, the following environment variables must be set in your environment (e.g., in a `.env.local` file for local development, or configured in your deployment environment):

- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string. This is essential for database operations.

### Email Configuration

For email functionalities (like sending ride confirmations) to work, you also need to configure the following SMTP server details:

- `EMAIL_HOST`: Hostname of your SMTP server (e.g., `smtp.example.com`).
- `EMAIL_PORT`: Port of your SMTP server (e.g., `587` for TLS or `465` for SSL).
- `EMAIL_USER`: Username for SMTP authentication.
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Password for SMTP authentication.
- `EMAIL_FROM`: The sender email address that will appear in the 'From' field (e.g., `"Your App Name" <noreply@example.com>`).

Ensure these variables are correctly set up before running the application or deploying it.
